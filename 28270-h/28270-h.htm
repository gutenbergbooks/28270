<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><i>The scene of this fantasy is an island, hitherto inhabited by
Lutherans, in a remote but temperate province of Northern Europe.
The persons are the Gods of Ancient Greece. The time is early in
the Twentieth Century.</i></p>

<h2><a name="Act_I" id="Act_I"></a>I</h2>

<p class="hang">[<i>A terrace high above the sea, which is seen far below, through
vast masses of woodland. Steps lead down towards the water, from
the centre of the scene. To the left, a large, low country-house,
of unpretentious character, in the style of the late eighteenth
century. Gardens belonging to the same period, and now somewhat
neglected and overgrown, stretch on either side. The edge of the
terrace is marked by a stone balustrade, with a stone seat running
round it within. At the top of steps, ascending, appear</i> <span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Eros</span>.]</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>A moment, Eros. Let us sit here. What can this flutter at my girdle
be? I

<!-- Page 4 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
breathe with difficulty. Oh! Eros, can this be death?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Death? Ah! no; you have roses in your cheeks, mother. Your lips are
like blood.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>It must be weariness. Ever these new sensations, these odd,
exciting apprehensions! This must be mortality. I never breathed
the faster as I rose from terrace to terrace in Cythera.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Yet this is like Cythera&mdash;a little like it. [<i>Looking round.</i>] It
is not the least like it. These round billowy woods, that grey
strip of sea far below, the long smooth land with square yellow
fields and pointed brown fields, and the wild grey

<!-- Page 5 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sky above. No;
it would be impossible for anything to be less like Cythera.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Yet it is like it. [<i>Gazing round.</i>] How strange ... to be where
everything is not azure and gold and white&mdash;white land, gold houses
and blue sky and sea. What are these woods, Eros?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Are they beech-woods?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>I did not think that I could ever be happy again. I am not <i>happy</i>.
But I am not miserable. Now that my heart is quiet again, I am not
miserable. Oh! that sick tossing on the black sea, the nausea, the
aching, the dulness; that I, who sprang from the waves, could come to

<!-- Page 6 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hate them so. We will never venture on the sea, again?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Then must we stay for ever here, since this is an island.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Yes, here for ever. For ever? We have no "for ever" now, Eros.</p>

<p class="hangind">[<i>Enter, from the house</i>, <span class="smcap">Cydippe</span>.]</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Is all prepared for us, Cydippe?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Cydippe.</span></p>

<p>I have done my best. The barbarian people are kind and clean. They
have blue eyes. There is one, with marigold curls and a crisp
beard, who has brought up water and logs of wood. There are two
maidens, with hair like a wheat-field and rough red fingers. There
are others....

<!-- Page 7 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
I know not. All seem civil and frightened. But your
Majesty will be wretched.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>No, Cydippe, I think I shall be happy.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros</span> [<i>walking to the parapet, and looking down</i>].</p>

<p>Our white ship still lies there, mother. Shall we start again?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>On that leaden water, with the little cruel breakers like coriander
seeds? Never. And whither should we go, Eros? We have lost our
golden home, our only home. We have lost the old white world of
empire; any grey corner of the world of stillness is good enough
for us. I will eat, and lie down, and rest without that long,
awful heave of the intolerable ocean. Which way, Cydippe?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros</span> [<i>alone</i>].</p>

<p>This little milk-white flower, with the drop of wine in it.... It
is like the grass that grows on the slopes of Parnassus. It is the
only home-like thing here. Can that be grey wool that hangs in the
sky, and droops like a curtain over the opposite hills? How cold
the air is! Ah! it is raining over in the other island, and the
brown fields grow like the yellow fields, melt into a mere white
mist behind the slate-coloured sea. Here is one of the barbarians.</p>

<p class="hangind">[<span class="smcap">Poseidon</span> <i>slowly appears at
the top of the steps</i>.]</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Poseidon.</span></p>

<p>Ah, you here alone, Eros?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros</span> [<i>aside</i>].</p>

<p>It is Poseidon! How old and bluff he looks! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Poseidon</span>.] My
mother is within. [<i>Smiling.</i>] She was angry with you, Poseidon,
but her anger is fallen.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Poseidon.</span></p>

<p>Adversity brings us all together. It was once I who burned with
anger against her. Why was she angry?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>The cruelty of your sea; it shook and sickened her.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Poseidon.</span></p>

<p>It once was her sea, too. Now it is not even mine.... Rebellion
everywhere, everywhere the servant risen against the master,
everywhere our spells and portents broken. I rule the sea still,
but it is as a man holds in a wild horse with a hard rein: it obeys
with hatred, it

<!-- Page 10 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
would obey not one moment after the master's hand
was withdrawn.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>How cold it is. But I am not disconsolate. Nor should you be,
Poseidon, for you will have the sea to occupy your thoughts.
Heph&aelig;stus will help you to break it in. He at least should be
consoled, for in our fallen estate his magical ingenuity will
employ his brain.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Poseidon.</span></p>

<p>We have never needed to be ingenious. It has been enough for us to
command, to wield the elements like weapons, to say it shall be and
to see it is.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>To see it is not, and yet to make it be, perhaps this may be a joy
in store for us. For Heph&aelig;stus, certainly; for you, if you are

<!-- Page 11 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
wise; but for me, ah! what will there be? My arrows break against
old hearts, and now we all are old.</p>

<p class="hangind">[<span class="smcap">Pallas Athene</span> <i>comes rapidly

<p>I have brought with me the box which Epimetheus made for Pandora.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros</span> [<i>turning suddenly</i>].</p>

<p>Ah! Pallas! What, you have brought that ivory box with you? Why did
you burden your hands with that?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>I snatched it from the burning palace. There is something strange
at the bottom of it&mdash;something like an opal, with a violet flame in
it.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Alas! we have no great need of jewels here. This shining beech-leaf
is the treasure you should wear, Pallas. See, a little bough of it,
bent just above the white enamel of your forehead. It will be as
green as a beryl to-day, and red like copper to-morrow, and perhaps
you will need no third adornment.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>There is something in the carven box which the shrieking oracle
commended to me. "Take this," it said, "take this, and it will turn
the blackness of exile into living light."</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Poor oracle, it became mad before it became dumb.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>I was the only one of us all, Eros, who anticipated

<!-- Page 13 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
this change.
High up above the glaciers of Olympus, where the warm crystal shone
like ice, and the faint cumuli rained jasmine on us, and the blue
light was like the cold acid of a fruit, in the midst of our
incomparable felicity I pondered on the vicissitude of things.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>You only, I remember, ever heeded the foolish screaming oracle that
moaned for mortals. You always had something of the mortal
temperament, Pallas. It jarred upon my mother that you seem to
shudder even at the voluptuous turmoil of the senses. She said you
always looked old. You look younger now than she does, Pallas.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>I am neither old nor young. I know not what I am. But this grey
colour and those

<!-- Page 14 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
blowing woods are not unpleasing to me. I can be
<i>myself</i>, even here, on a beech-wood peak in the cold sea.</p>

<p>It is some dark bird of the north; it seeks a prey in the
woodlands.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Zeus.</span></p>

<p>I think it is a vulture. My eagle fled from me when the rebel
whistled to it. It perched beside him, and smoothed its crest
against his elbow. All have left me, even my eagle.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>Father, we have not left you. We are about you here. One by one the
alleys of the beech-wood will open, and one after one we shall all
gather here, all your children, all the Olympians.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Zeus.</span></p>

<p>I will not say. Are you sure [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Poseidon</span>] that is not a vulture?
I am torn, see, here under my beard, by a thorn. I can feel pain at
last, <i>I</i>, who could only inflict it.</p>

<p>Pallas has something in a box&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Zeus</span> [<i>vehemently</i>].</p>

<p>There is nothing in any box, there is nothing in any island, there
is nothing in all the empty caskets of this world which can give
me any happiness. Is it in this shanty that we must live? Lead me
on, Ganymede,

<p>Is Zeus very much disturbed? On the

<!-- Page 26 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
ship I heard &AElig;olus say that it
was impossible to go near him, he was so unreasonably angry.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>Yes, he thought that our miseries were all the fault of Poseidon
and &AElig;olus. But mortality will make a great change in Zeus; I think
perhaps a greater change than in any of us. He has eaten a very
substantial breakfast. &AElig;sculapius says that as Zeus has hitherto
considered the quality of his food so much, it is probable that in
these lower conditions it may prove to be quantity which will
interest him most. He was greatly pleased with a curious kind of
aromatic tube which Hermes invented for him this morning.</p>

here?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Rhea.</span></p>

<p>I must look after Kronos, of course. But he gives me no trouble.
And I do not need to do much more. I am very tired, Circe. I was
tired in my immortality. When Kronos and I were young, things were
so very different in Olympus.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>How were they different? Do tell me what happened. I have always
longed to know, but it was not considered quite nice, quite
respectful to Zeus, for us to ask questions about the Golden Age.
But now it cannot matter; can it, Rhea?</p>

<p>The fact is that when I look back, I cannot see very plainly any
longer. Do you know, Circe, that after the younger Gods invaded
Heaven, although Zeus was very good-natured to us, and let us go on
as deities, something of our god-head passed away?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Kronos</span> [<i>aloud, to himself</i>].</p>

<p>I said to him, "If I am unwelcome, I can go." And he answered,
"Pray don't discommode yourself." Just like that; very politely,
"Don't discommode yourself." And now he drives us away after all.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe</span> [<i>flinging herself over to</i> <span class="smcap">Kronos'</span> <i>knees</i>].</p>

<p>Oh! Kronos, he does not drive you away! It is not he. It is our new
enemies, not of our own race, that have driven us. And we are all
here&mdash;Pallas, Ares, Ph&oelig;bus&mdash;we are all here. You like Hermes,

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Kronos.</span></p>

<p>I thought that Zeus had forgiven us. But never mind, never mind!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Rhea.</span></p>

<p>We are tired, Circe. And what does the new life matter to us now?
The old life had run low, and we had long been prepared for
mortality by the poverty of our immortality.</p>

<p>She has always been so closely wedded to the study of agriculture,

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>Precisely. And it has occurred to me that the way to rouse her will
be to send Persephone to her in a little country cart I have

harnessed&mdash;such little beauties. The only thing left to do is to
search for Persephone.</p>

<p>He has mentioned it only twice this morning, and I have set
Heph&aelig;stus to work to make him another, of yew-tree wood. It will be

time Zeus will forget the original.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Kronos</span> [<i>loudly, to himself</i>].</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes</span> [<i>in the same tone</i>].</p>

<p>Do not distress him, Rhea, by contradiction and explanation. I will
find modes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of amusing him a little every day, and, for the rest,
let him doze in the sunshine. His mind is worn so smooth that it
fails any longer to catch in ideas as they flit against it. They
pass off, glide away. It is useless, Rhea, to torment Kronos.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Rhea.</span></p>

<p>I shall watch him, all day long. For I, too, am weary. Do not
propose to me, with your restless energy, any fresh interests. Let
me sit, with my cold hands folded in my lap, and look at Kronos,
nodding, nodding. It is very kind of Circe, but we are too old for
love; and of you, but we are too old for amusement. Let us rest,
Hermes, rest and sleep; perhaps dream a little, dream of the
far-away past.</p>

<p>My mother requires so much activity of mind and body. You must not

morning to see what I could invent, adapt, discover, as a means of
rousing her. I am stupid, I could think of nothing. I wandered
through the woods, down the glen, along the sea-shore, up the side
of the tarn and of the marsh, but I could think of nothing.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>And when I found Persephone she was lying, flung out among the
flowers, with bees and butterflies leaping round her in the

forget or to remember. We must live in the past or forego the past.
For Pan and his likes I conceive that it will largely resolve
itself into a question of temperature&mdash;of temperature and of
appetite. That orb is of a sinister appearance, but to do it
justice it looks heated. My sister had a passion for coldness; she
would never permit me to lend her any of my warmth. I cannot say
that it is chilly here to-night. I am agreeably surprised.</p>

<p>What an amiable vivacity! Yes; the lower order of divinities will
be happy, for they will forget. We, on the contrary, have the
privilege of remembering. It is only the mediocre spirits, that
cannot quite

<p>Not the Daulian nightingale, of course, but quite a personable
substitute: less prolongation of the triumph, less insistence upon
the agony. How curiously the note breaks off! Some pleasant little
northern bird, no doubt. I experience a strange and quite
unprecedented appetite for moderation. The absence of the thrill,
the shaft, the torrent is not disagreeable. The actual Phocian
frenzy would be disturbing here, out of place, out of time. I must
congratulate this little, doubtless brown, bird on a very
considerable skill in warbling. But the moon&mdash;what

<!-- Page 51 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
is happening to
<i>it</i>? It is not merely climbing higher, but it is manifestly
clarifying its light. When I came, it was copper-coloured, now it
is honey-coloured, the horn of it is almost white like milk. This
little bird's incantation has, without question, produced this
fortunate effect. This little bird, halfway on the road between the
nightingale and the cicada, is doubtless an enchanter, and one
whose art possesses a more than respectable property. My sister's
attention should be drawn to this highly interesting circumstance.

concoct

obscure. It would be a pity to inquire into it so closely as to
comprehend it.</p>

<p>To comprehend it might even be to discover that it does not exist.
Whereas to come here night after night, in the fragrant darkness,
to see the unhallowed lump of fire creep out of the lake, to
listen for the first clucks and shakes of the sweet little
purifying song, and to watch the

concord of nature would be then patent and recurrent before us. My
poor sister! However, it is consoling to reflect that she is
almost certain not to be able to find that bird.</p>

and away to sea. The rarest sorts were flung about on rocks where
nothing more valetudinarian than a baboon could possibly taste

<p>We must not detain you, &AElig;sculapius. But tell us how you propose to

<p>Does it not occur to you, Pallas, that&mdash;although I should never
have had the courage to adopt it&mdash;thus forced upon us it offers me
the most dazzling anticipations? Hitherto my existence has been all
theory. What there is to know about the principles of health as
applied to the fluctuations of mortality, I may suppose is known to
me. You might be troubled, Pallas, with every conceivable malady,
from elephantiasis to earache, and I should be in a position to
analyse and to deal with each in turn. You might be obscured by
ophthalmia, crippled by gout or consumed to a spectre by phthisis,
and I should be able, without haste, without anxiety, to unravel
the coil, to reduce the nodosities, to make the fleshy instrument
respond in melody to all your needs.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>But you have never done this. We knew

<!-- Page 65 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that you <i>could</i> do it, and that has been enough for us.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>It has never been enough for me. The impenetrable immortality of
all our bodies has been a constant source of exasperation to me.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>Is it not much to know?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>Yes; but it is more to <i>do</i>. The most perfect theory carries a
monotony and an emptiness about with it, if it is never renovated
by practice. In Olympus the unbroken health of all the inmates,
which we have accepted as a matter of course, has been more
advantageous to them than it has been to me.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>It has made it purely academic, and indeed, Pallas, if you will
reflect upon it, the very existence of a physician in a social
system which is eternally protected against every species of bodily
disturbance borders upon the ridiculous.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>It would interest me to know whether in our old home you were
conscious of this incongruity, of this lack of harmony between your
science and your occasions of using it.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>No; I think not. I was satisfied in the possession of exact
knowledge, and not directly

<!-- Page 67 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
aware of the charm of application. It
is the result, no doubt, of this resignation of immortality which
has startled and alarmed us all so much&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>Me, &AElig;sculapius, it has neither alarmed nor startled.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>I mean that while we were beyond the dread of any attack, the
pleasure of rebutting such attack was unknown to us. I have
divined, since our misfortunes, that disease itself may bring an
excitement with it not all unallied to pleasure.... You smile,
Euterpe, but I mean even for the sufferer. There is more in disease
than the mere pang and languishment. There is the sense of
alleviation, the cessation of the throb, the resuming glitter in
the eye, the restoration of cheerfulness and appetite. These,

<!-- Page 68 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Pallas, are qualities which are indissolubly identified with pain
and decay, and which therefore&mdash;if we rightly consider&mdash;were wholly
excluded from our experience. In Olympus we never brightened, for
we never flagged; we never waited for a pang to subside, nor felt
it throbbing less and less poignantly, nor, as if we were watching
an enemy from a distance, hugged ourselves in a breathless ecstasy
as it faded altogether; this exquisite experience was unknown to
us, for we never endured the pang.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Euterpe.</span></p>

<p>You make me eager for an illness. What shall it be? Prescribe one
for me. I am ignorant even of the names of the principal maladies.
Let it be a not unbecoming one.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>Ah! no, Euterpe. Your mind still runs

<!-- Page 69 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in the channel of your lost
impermeability. Till now, you might fling yourself from the crags
of Tartarus, or float, like a trail of water-plants, on the long,
blown flood of the altar-flame, and yet take no hurt, being
imperishable. But now, part of your hourly occupation, part of your
faith, your hope, your duty, must be to preserve your body against
the inroads of decay.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Euterpe.</span></p>

<p>You present us with a tedious conception of our new existence,
surely.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>Why should it be tedious? There was tedium, rather, in the
possession of bodies as durable as metal, as renewable as wax, as
insensitive as water. In the fiercest onset of the passions,
prolonged to satiety, there was always an element of

<!-- Page 70 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the unreal.
What is pleasure, if the strain of it is followed by no fatigue;
what the delicacy of taste, if we can eat like caverns and drink
like conduits without being vexed by the slightest inconvenience?
You will discover that one of the acutest enjoyments of the mortal
state will be found to consist in guarding against suffering. If
you are provided with balloons attached to all your members, you
float upon the sea with indifference. It is the certainty that you
will drown if you do not swim which gives zest to the exercise. I
climb along yonder jutting cornice of the cliff with eagerness, and
pluck my simples with a hand that trembles more from joy than fear,
precisely because the strain of balancing the nerves, and the
certainty of suffering as the result of carelessness, knit my
sensations together into an exaltation which is not exactly
pleasure, perhaps, but which is not to be distinguished

<!-- Page 71 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>Is life, then, to resolve itself for us into a chain of
exhilarating pangs?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>Life will now be for you, for all of us, a perpetual combat with a
brine that half supports, half drags us under; a continual creeping
and balancing on a chamois path around the forehead of a precipice.
A headache will be the breaking of a twig, a fever a stone that
gives way beneath your foot, to lose the use of an organ will be to
let the alpenstock slip out of your starting fingers. And the
excitement, and be sure the happiness, of existence will be to
protract the struggle as long as possible, to push as far as you
can along the dwindling path, to keep the supports and the
alleviations of your labour

<!-- Page 72 -->

to do my hair. I really came out on this rather mad adventure after
the raspberries to escape the dolours of her countenance, and the
last thing I saw was her chlamys flung wildly over her head as she
dived down upon the floor in misery. Such consolations as this
island has to give me will not proceed from what you call my
attendant. You do not look well, Ares.</p>

<p>You do not, I hope, give way to the most foolish of the emotions,

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>I have nothing to reproach myself with. Our forces had never been
in smarter trim, public spirit in Olympus never more patriotic and
national; and as to the personal bravery of our forces, it was
simply a portent of moral splendour.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>And your discipline?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>It was perfect. I had led the troops up to the point of cheerfully
marching and counter-marching until they were ready to drop with
exhaustion, on the eve of each engagement; and at the ends of all
our practising-grounds brick walls had been set up, at which every
officer made it a point of honour to tilt head-foremost once a day.
There was no refinement preserved from the good old wars of
chivalry which was not familiar to our gallant fellows, and I had
expressly forbidden every species of cerebral exercise. Nothing, I
have always said, is so hurtful to the temper of an army as for the
rank and file to suspect that they are led by men of brains.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>There every one must do you justice, Ares.

I never heard even the voice of prejudice raised to accuse you.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>No; I do not think any one could have the effrontery to charge me
with encouraging that mental effort which is so disastrous to the
work of a soldier. The same old practices which led our forefathers
to glory&mdash;the courage of tigers; the firm belief that if any one
tried to be crafty it must be because he is a coward; a bull-front
set straight at every obstacle, whatever its nature; a proper
contempt for any plan or discovery made since the days of Father
Uranus&mdash;these are the principles in which I disciplined our troops,
and I will not admit that I can have anything to reproach myself
with. The circumstances which we were unexpectedly called upon to
face were such as could never have been anticipated.</p>

<p>Do not speak of it! I could never have believed that the semblance
of the military could be made so excessively distasteful to me.</p>

<p>Your friends are all aware, Ares, that if the conditions were to
return, you would never demean yourself and them by guarding
against anything of the kind. But I advise you not to brood upon
the past. Your figure will suffer. You must keep up your character
for solid and agile exercises.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>It will not be easy for me to occupy myself here. I am accustomed,
as you know, to hunting and slaying. I thought I might have enjoyed
some sport with the barbarian islanders, and I selected one for the
purpose. But Zeus intervened, with that authority which even here,
in our shattered estate, we know not how to resist.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Did he give any reason for preventing the combat?</p>

</div>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>Yes; and his reasons (I was bound to admit) carried some weight
with them. He said, first, that it was wrong to kill those who had
received us with so generous a hospitality; and secondly, that, as
I am no longer immortal, this brawny savage, with hair so curiously
coiled and matted over his brain-pan, might kill me; and thirdly,
that the whole affair might indirectly lead to his, Zeus', personal
inconvenience. Here then is enjoyment by one door quite shut out
from me.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Are there not deer in these woods, and perhaps wolves and boars?
There must be wild duck on the firth, and buzzards in the rocks.
Instead of challenging the barbarians to a foolish trial of
strength, why not make them your companions, and learn their
accomplishments?</p>

<p>It is possible that I shall do so. But for the present, anger
gushes like an intermittent spring of bitter water in my bosom. I
forget for a moment, and the fountain falls; and then, with a rush,
memory leaps up in me, a column of poison. I say to myself, It
cannot be, it shall not be; but I grow calm again and find that it
is.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>The worst of the old immortality was the carelessness of it. We
were utterly unprepared for anything bordering on catastrophe, and
behold, without warning, we are swept away in a complete cataclysm
of our fortunes. I see, Ares, that it will be long before you can
recover serenity, or take advantage of the capabilities of our new
existence. They will appeal to you more slowly than to the rest of
us, and you will respond more unwillingly,

<!-- Page 89 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
because of your
lack&mdash;your voluntary and boasted lack&mdash;of all intellectual
suppleness.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>It is not the business of a soldier to be supple.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>So it appears. And you will suffer for it. For, stiff and blank as
you may determine to be, circumstances will overpower you. Under
their influences you will not be able to avoid becoming softer and
more redundant. But you will resist the process, I see, and you
will make it as painful as you can.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>You discuss my case with a cheerful candour, Aphrodite. Are you
sure of being happier yourself?</p>

<p>Not <i>sure</i>; but I have a reasonable confidence that I shall be
fairly contented. For I, at least, am supple, and I court the
influences which you think it a point of gallantry to resist.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>You will continue, I suppose, to make your main business the
stimulating and the guiding of the affections? Here I admit that
suppleness, as you call it, is in place.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, even here, immortality was no convenient prelude to
our present state. We did not, indeed, neglect the heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There, at least, memory supplies me with no sort of doubt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> [<i>coldly</i>].</p>

<p>Let us keep to generalities. Looking broadly at our experience, I
should say that the misfortune of the gods, as a preparation for
their mortality, was that in their deathless state the affections
fell at the foot of the tree, like these withered leaves. We should
have fastened the branches of life together in long elastic wires
of the thin-drawn gold of perdurable sentiment.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>The rapture, the violence, the hammering pulse, the bursting
heart,&mdash;I see no resemblance between these and the leaves that
flutter at our feet.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>These leaves had their moment of vitality, when the sap rushed
through their veins, when their tissue was like a ripple of
sparkling emerald on the face of the smiling sky. But they could
not preserve their glow, and they are the more hopelessly dead now,
because they burned in their green fire so fiercely.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>We felt no shadow of coming disability strike across our pleasures.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>No; but that was precisely what made our immortality such an ill
preparation for

<!-- Page 93 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a brief existence on this island. In Olympus the
sentiment of yesterday was forgotten, and we realised the passion
of to-day as little as the caprice of to-morrow. Perhaps this
fragmentary tenderness was the real chastisement of our implacable
prosperity.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares</span> [<i>in a very low voice</i>].</p>

<p>Can we not resume in this our exile, and with more prospect of
continuity, the emotions which were so agreeable in our former
state? So agreeable&mdash;although, as you justly say, too ephemeral
[<i>coming a little closer</i>]. Can you not teach us to moderate and to
prolong the rapture?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> [<i>rising to her feet</i>].</p>

<p>It may be. We shall see, Ares. But one thing I have already
perceived. In this mortal sphere, the heart needs solitude, it
needs silence. It must have its questionings

<!-- Page 94 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and its despairs. The
triumphant supremacy of the old emotions cannot be repeated here.
For we have a new enemy to contend with. Even if love should
prosecute its conquests here in all the serenity of success, it
will not be able to escape from an infliction worse than any which
we dreamed of when we were immortals.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ares.</span></p>

<p>And what is that, Aphrodite?</p>

<p>I think it must be to you, Aphrodite, for now it is explained that
on coming hither I met a throng of men and maidens, sauntering

<!-- Page 98 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
slowly along in twos, exactly as they used to do at Paphos.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Were they walking apart, or wound together by garlands?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>They were wound together by the arm of the boy coiled about the
waist of the girl, or resting upon it, a symbol, no doubt, of your
cestus.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> [<i>eagerly</i>].</p>

<p>With any animation of gesture, Circe?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>With absolutely none. The maidens were dressed&mdash;but not all of
them&mdash;in robes of that very distressing electric blue that bites
into the eye, that blue which never was on sky or sea, and which
was absolutely banished from every colour-combination

<!-- Page 99 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in Olympus.
It was employed in Hades as a form of punishment, if you recollect.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>No doubt, then, this procession was a penitential one, and its
object to appease my offended deity. But what a mistake, poor
things! No one ever regained my favour by making a frump of
herself.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>After these couples, came, in a very slow but formless moving
group, figures of a sombre and spectral kind, draped, both males
and females, in dull black, with little ornaments of gold in their
hands. It was with the utmost amazement that, on their coming
closer, I recognised some of the faces as those of the ruddy,
gentle barbarians to whom we owe our existence here. You cannot
think how painful it was to see them thus

<!-- Page 100 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
travestied. In their
well-fitting daily dress they look very attractive in a rustic
mode; there is one large one that labours in the barn, who reminds
me, when his sleeves are turned up, of Ulysses. But, oh! Aphrodite,
you must contrive to let them know that you pardon their
shortcomings, and relieve them from the horrors of this remorseful
costume. I know not which is more depressing to the heart, the blue
of the young or the black of the aged.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>I expect that at this distance from the centre of things, all
manner of misconception has crept into my ritual. Of course, I
cannot now demand any rites, and that the dear good people should
pay them at all is very touching.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>Don't you think that it would be delightful

<!-- Page 101 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to introduce here a
purer form of liturgy? It is very sad to see your spirit so little
understood.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Well, I hardly know. It is kind of you, Circe, to suggest such a
thing. No doubt it would be very pleasant. But I feel, of course,
the hollowness of the whole concern. We must be careful not to
deceive the barbarians.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>Certainly ... oh! yes, certainly. But ... I am sure it would be so
good for them to have a ritual to follow. We should not absolutely
assert to them that you still exist as an immortal, but I do not
see why we should insist on tearing every illusion away from them.
Suppose I could persuade them that you were no longer displeased
with them, and that you were quite willing to let them wear pink
and

<!-- Page 102 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
white robes again, and plenty of flowers in their hair; and
suppose I encouraged them to sacrifice turtle-doves on your altar,
and arrange garlands of wild roses in the proper way, don't you
think you could bring yourself to make a concession?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by a "concession"?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>Well, for instance, when they were all assembled in the temple, and
had sung a hymn, and the priest had gone up to the altar, could you
not suddenly make an appearance, voluminous and splendid, and smile
upon them? Could you not shower a few champak-blossoms over the
congregation?</p>

<p>It is very ingenious of you to think of these things. But I suppose
it would not be right to attempt to do it. In the first place it
would encourage them to believe in my immortality&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>Oh! but to <i>believe</i> is such a salutary discipline to the lower
classes. That is the whole principle of religion, surely,
Aphrodite? It is not for people like ourselves. You know how
indolent Dionysus is, but he always attended the temple when he was
hunting upon Nysa.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>There is a great deal in that argument, no doubt. Only, what will
be the result when they discover that it is all a mistake, and
that I am a mortal like themselves?</p>

soft red silk. They will always worship you. It may not be in
temples any longer, not with a studied liturgy, but wherever the
sap rises in a flower, or the joy of life swims up in the morning
through the broken film of dreams, or a young man perceives for the
first time that the girl he meets is comely, you will be
worshipped, Aphrodite, for the essence of your immortality is the
cumulative glow of its recurrent mortality.</p>

naked floors.</p>

<p>But what is the nature of the sculpture?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>I could see no sculpture, except a sort of black tablet, with names
upon it, and at the sides two of the youthful attendants of
Eros&mdash;those that have wings, indeed, but cannot rest. These were
exceedingly

<!-- Page 107 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
ill-carven in a kind of limestone. And I hardly like to

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>I am not easily shocked. My poor worshippers sometimes demand a

<p>Nothing very ugly, I hope?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>Yes; very ugly, and still more incomprehensible. But nothing that
could spring out of any misconception of the ritual of our friend.
No; I hardly like to tell you. Well, a gaunt painted figure, with
spines about the bleeding forehead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Was it fastened to any symbol? Did you

notice anything that explained the horror of it?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>No. I did not observe it very closely. As I was glancing at it, the
celebration or ritual, or whatever we are to call it, began, and I
withdrew to the door, not knowing what frenzy might seize upon the
worshippers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>There was a cannibal altar in Arcadia to Ph&oelig;bus, so I have
heard. He instantly destroyed it, and scattered the ignorant
savages who had raised it.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>There was a touch of desolate majesty about this figure. I fear

<p>I admit that I thought, with this picture, and with their sinister
garments of black and of blue, and with the bareness and harshness
of the temple, that something might be combined which it would give
me no satisfaction to witness. I placed myself near the door,
where, in a moment, I could have regained the exquisite forest, and
the odour of this carpet of woodruff, and your enchanting society.
But nothing occurred to disconcert me. After genuflexions and

open box, and spoke to the audience from the upturned lid of it.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Circe.</span></p>

<p>What did he say? Did he explain the religion of his people?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes.</span></p>

<p>To tell you the truth, Circe, although I listened with what
attention I could, and although the actual language was perfectly
clear to me&mdash;you know I am rather an accomplished linguist&mdash;I
formed no idea of what he said. I could not find the
starting-point of his experience.</p>

<p>To whom can this temple be possibly dedicated?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite.</span></p>

<p>Depend upon it, it is not a temple at all. What Hermes was present
at was unquestionably some gathering of local politicians. Poor
these barbarians may be, but they could not excuse by poverty such
a neglect of the decencies as he describes. No flowers, no bright
robes, no music of stringed instruments, no sacrifice&mdash;it is quite
impossible that the meanest of sentient beings should worship in
such a manner. And as for the picture which you saw behind what you
took to be the altar, I question not that it is used to keep in
memory some ancestor who suffered from the tyranny of his masters.
In the belief that he was assisting at a process of rustic worship,
our

<p>Not in its present position. But I will not pretend, Eros, that it
is not the source of my agitation. Look at it now, as it flings
itself round the stalk, and opens and waves its fans. Do you still
not comprehend?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>I see nothing in it now. I am disappointed.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>But those great coloured eyes, waxing and waning! Those moons of
pearl! The copper that turns to crimson, the turquoise that turns
to violet, the greenish, pointed head that swings and rolls its
yoke of slender plumage! Ah! Eros, is it possible that you do not
perceive that it is a symbol of my peacock, my bird translated
into the language of this narrow and suppressed existence of ours?
What a

<!-- Page 118 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
strange and exquisite messenger! My poor peacock, with a
strident shriek of terror, fled from me on that awful morning, the
flames singeing its dishevelled train, its wings helplessly
flapping in the torrents of conflagration. It bade me no adieu, its
clangour of despair rang forth, an additional note of discord, from
the inner courts of my palace. And out of its agony, of its horror,
it has contrived to send me this adorable renovation of itself, all
its grace and all its splendour reincarnated in this tiny creature.
But alas! how am I to capture, how to communicate with it?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>I hesitate to disturb your illusion, Hera. But you are singularly
mistaken. I have a far greater interest in this messenger than you
can have; and if you dream its presence to be a tribute to your
pride, I am much more tenderly certain

<!-- Page 119 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that it is a reproach to my
affections. See, those needlessly gaudy wings,&mdash;a mere disguise to
bring it through the multitude of its enemies&mdash;are closed now, and
it resumes its pendulous attitude, as a&euml;rial as an evening cloud,
as graceful as sorrow itself, sable as the shadow of a leaf in the
moonlight.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>Whom do you suppose it to represent, Eros?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>"Represent" is an inadequate word. I know it to be, in some
transubstantiation, the exact nature of which I shall have to
investigate, my adored and injured Psyche. You never appreciated
her, Hera.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>It was necessary in such a society as ours

<!-- Page 120 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to preserve the
hierarchical distinctions. She was a charming little creature, and
I never allowed myself to indulge in the violent prejudice of your
mother. When you presented her at last, I do not think that you had
any reason to reproach me with want of civility.</p>

<p class="hangind">[<i>The butterfly dances off.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>We are in a curious dilemma. Unless we are to conceive that two of
the lesser Olympians have been able to combine in adopting a
symbolic disguise, either you or I have been deceived. That
tantalising visitant can scarcely have been at the same time Psyche
and my peacock.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>I know not why; and for my part am

<!-- Page 121 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
perfectly willing to recognise
its spots and moons to your satisfaction, if you will permit me to
recognise my own favourite in the garb of grief.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>My bird was ever a masquerader&mdash;it may be so.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Psyche, also, was not unaccustomed to disguises.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>You take the recollection coolly, Eros.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Would you have me shriek and moan? Would you have me throw myself
in convulsive ecstasy upon that ambiguous insect? You are not the
first, Hera, who has gravely misunderstood my character. I am not,
I have never been, a victim of the

<!-- Page 122 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
impulsive passions. The only
serious misunderstandings which I have ever had with my illustrious
mother have resulted from her lack of comprehension of this fact.
<i>She</i> is impulsive, if you will! Her existence has been a
succession of centrifugal adventures, in which her sole idea has
been to hurl herself outward from the solitude of her
individuality. I, on the other hand, leave very rarely, and with
peculiar reluctance, the rock-crystal tower from which I watch the
world, myself unavoidable and unattainable. My arrows penetrate
every disguise, every species of physical and spiritual armour, but
they are not turned against my own heart. I have always been
graceful and inconspicuous in my attitudes. The image of Eros, with
contorted shoulders and projected elbows, aiming a shaft at
himself, is one which the Muse of Sculpture would shudder to
contemplate.</p>

<p>Then what was the meaning of your apparent infatuation for Psyche?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>O do not call it "apparent." It was genuine and it was
all-absorbing. But it was absolutely exceptional. Looking back, it
seems to me that I must have been gazing at myself in a mirror, and
have dismissed an arrow before I realised who was the quarry. It is
not necessary to remind you of the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>You would, I suppose, describe them as exceptional?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>As wholly exceptional. And could I be expected to prolong an ardour
so foreign to my nature? The victim of passion cannot be a
contemplator at the same

<!-- Page 124 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
moment, and I may frankly admit to you,
Hera, that during the period of my infatuation for Psyche, there
were complaints from every province of the universe. It was said
that unless my attention could be in a measure diverted from that
admirable girl, there would be something like a stagnation of
general vitality. Ph&oelig;bus remarked one day, that if the ploughman
became the plough the cessation of harvests would be inevitable.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>It was at that moment, I suppose, that you besought Zeus so
passionately to confer upon Psyche the rank of a goddess?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>You took that, no doubt, for an evidence of my intenser
infatuation. An error; it was a proof that the arguments of the
family were beginning to produce their effect

<!-- Page 125 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
upon me. I perceived
my responsibility, and I recognised that it was not the place of
the immortal organiser of languishment to be sighing himself. To
deify my lovely Psyche was to recognise her claim, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>To give you a convenient excuse for neglecting her?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>It is that crudity of yours, Hera, which has before now made your
position in Olympus so untenable. You lack the art of elegant
insinuation.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>Am I then to believe that you were playing a part when you seemed
a little while ago so anxious to recognise Psyche in the drooping
butterfly?</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Eros.</span></p>

<p>Oh! far from it. The sentiment of recognition was wholly genuine
and almost rapturously pleasurable. It is true that in the
confusion of our flight I had not been able to give a thought to
our friend, who was, unless I am much mistaken, absent from her
palace. Nor will I be so absurd as to pretend that I have, for a
long while past, felt at all keenly the desire for her company. She
has very little conversation. There are certain peculiarities of
manner, which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hera.</span></p>

<p>I know exactly what you mean. My peacock has a very peculiar voice,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>You must permit me to protest against any comparison between Psyche

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
bird. But I was going to say that the moment I saw
the brilliant little discrepancy which led us both to this
spot&mdash;and to which I hesitate to give a more definite name&mdash;I was
instantly and most pleasantly reminded of certain delightful
episodes, of a really charming interlude, if I may so call it. I
cannot be perfectly certain what connection our ebullient
high-flyer has with the goddess whose adorer I was and whose friend
I shall ever be. But the symbol&mdash;if it be no more than a
symbol&mdash;has been sufficient to awaken in me all that was most
enjoyable in our relations. I shall often wander in these woods,
among the cloud-like masses of odorous blossom, in this windless
harbour of sunlight and the murmur of leaves, in the hope of
finding the little visitant here. She will never fail to remind me,
but without disturbance, of all that was happiest in a series of
relations which grew at last not so wholly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
felicitous as they once
had been. One of the pleasures this condition of mortality offers
us, I foresee, is the perpetual recollection of what was delightful
in the one serious liaison of my life, and of nothing else.</p>

dimness over everything, and I never entered into the political
life of the place. As to the social life, you can imagine that they
were not people that one cared to know. At the same time, of
course, I feel now how ridiculous it was

<p>We thought of it as of something happening in that world of Hades

leisurely, with dignity or
without it, the garments of our sensuous existence, and discover
something underneath all these textures of the body?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Persephone.</span></p>

<p>One of our priests in Hades, I do remember, sang that silence was a
voice, and declared that even in the deserts of immensity the soul
was stunned and deafened by the chorus and anti-chorus of nature.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chloris.</span></p>

<p>What did he mean? What is the soul?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Maia.</span></p>

<p>I must confess that in this our humility, our corporeal
degradation, instead of feeling crushed, I am curiously conscious
of a wider range of sensibility. Perhaps that

<!-- Page 141 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
is the soul? Perhaps,
in the suppression of our immortality, something metallic,
something hermetical, has been broken down, and already we stand
more easily exposed to the influences of the spirit?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Chloris.</span></p>

<p>In that case, to slough the sheaths of the body, one by one, ought
to be to come nearer to the final freedom, and the last coronation
and consecration of existence may prove to be this very "death" we
dread so much.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Persephone.</span></p>

<p>I can fancy that such conjectures as these may prove to be one of
the chief sources of satisfaction in this new mortality of ours:
the variegated play of light and shadow thrown upon it. Well,

<!-- Page 142 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the less we know and see, the more exciting it ought to be to guess and
to peer.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Maia.</span></p>

<p>And some of us, depend upon it, will be able to persuade ourselves

<!-- Page 159 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
such an attitude as that the unnamed, the undescribed object rises
full in vision. The poet flings forth his melody, and to the gross
ear it seems a mere tinkle of inanity. That is simply because the
crowd who worship at the shrine of the Sminthean Apollo have been
accustomed by an old-fashioned and ridiculously incompetent
priesthood to look for an instant and mechanical relation between
sound and sense. I would not exaggerate, sire; but the kind of
poetry lately cultivated, not only at Delphi, but in Delos also, is

<p>The attitude of my family, in these ambiguous circumstances, is
everything that could be desired. My original feeling of
irritability has passed away. I should have supposed it to be what
Pallas calls "fatigue," a confusion or discord of the
nerve-centres, which she tells me is incident to mortality. What
Pallas can possibly know about it is more than I can guess,
especially, as there were not infrequent occasions on Olympus
itself on which my Supreme Godhead was disturbed by flashes of what
I should be forced to describe as exasperation, states of mind in
which I formed&mdash;and indeed executed&mdash;the sudden project of
breaking something. These were, I believe, simply the

<!-- Page 162 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
result of an
excessive sense of responsibility. I am not one of those who
conceive that the duty of deity is to sit passive beside the cup of
nectar. Here on this island, in the permanent absence of that
refreshment, I reflect (I perceive that I shall have very frequent
opportunities for reflection) that I was perhaps only too anxious
to preserve the harmony of heaven. My sense of decorum&mdash;may it not
have been excessive? From below, as I imagine, from the stations
occupied&mdash;I will not say by the inanimate or half-animate creation,
such as insects, or men, or minerals&mdash;but by the demi-gods, I take
it that the dignity and orbic beauty of our court appeared
sublimely immaculate. In the inner circle, alas! no one knows
better than I do that there were&mdash;well, dissensions. I will go
further, in candour to myself, and admit that these occasionally
led to excesses. I cannot charge my recollection with my having done

<!-- Page 163 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
anything to excuse or encourage these. The personal conduct of
the Sovereign was always, I cannot but believe, above reproach. But
the eccentricities&mdash;if I may style them so&mdash;of certain of my
children were sometimes regrettable. I wonder that they did not age
me; they would do so immediately in my present condition. But in
this island, where we are to swarm like animalcules in a drop of
water, I shall be relieved of all responsibility. Where there is no
one to notice that errors are committed, no errors <i>are</i> committed.
As the person of most experience in the whole world, I do not mind
stating my ripe opinion that a fault which has no effect upon
political conditions is in no sensible degree a fault at all.
Pallas would contend the point, I suppose, but I am at ease. I
shall not allow the conduct of my children, except as it shall
regard myself, to affect my good-humour in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>It will not raise mine; for all of you, Eros, have been immortals

and I am not its dupe. It simply carries me back to the ancient
weary round of ceaseless struggle, unending battle, incessant
renascence of the sprouting heads of Hydra; to all that from which
the windless Olympus was a refuge. Hope is presented&mdash;to one who
has tasted it and who knows that it is futile&mdash;without reawakening,
under such new conditions as we have here, any zest of adventure.
The jewel of Pandora may be exhilarating to fallen immortality; it
has no lustre whatever for a backsliding mortal.</p>

her. She goes about
in a perpetual incognito. Poor thing, in our flight from Olympus

burned, she flung her armour away, and her palm-tree obstinately
refused to up-root itself.</p>

<p>It was always rather a poor palm-tree. What Nike misses most are
her wings. She was excessively dejected when we first arrived, but
Pallas very kindly allowed her to take care of the jewel for half
an hour. Nike&mdash;if still hardly recognisable&mdash;is no longer to be

<p>&AElig;sculapius, they were not girls. They were the terrible and ancient
Eumenides, black with the curdled blood of Uranus. They were the
inexorable Furies, who were wont to fawn about my feet, with the
adders quivering in their tresses, tormenting me for the spoils of
victory. What does it mean? Why are they in white? As we came
hither in the dreadful vessel, they were huddled together at the
prow, and their long black raiment hung overboard and touched the
brine. They were mumbling and crooning hate-songs, and pointing
with skinny fingers to the portents in the sky. What

<!-- Page 195 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
is it that has
changed their mood? What is it that can have turned the robes of

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">&AElig;sculapius.</span></p>

<p>Is it not because a like strange metamorphosis has invaded your own
nature that you have come to meet me here?</p>

<p>I am bewildered, but I am not unhappy. I come because the secrets
of life are known to you. I come because it was you whom Zeus sent

change came over them. They were weary with grief and defeat, tired
of being for ever overwhelmed by the ever-mounting wave of mortal
fate. I am weary&mdash;&mdash;</p>

self?</p>

<p>Can it be so? I find, it is true, that I look back upon my rush

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
it was,
the perpetual clash and resonance of a victory that no one could
withstand; the mockery that conquest must be to an immortal whom no
one can ever really oppose;&mdash;no veritable difficulty to overcome,
no genuine resistance to meet, nothing positively tussled with and
thrown, nothing but ghostly armies shrinking and melting a little
way in front of my advancing eagles! That can never happen again,
and even through the pang of losing my laurel and my wings, I did
not genuinely deplore it. Nothing but the sheer intoxication of my
immortality had kept me at the pitch. And now that it is gone, oh
wisest of the gods, it is for you to tell me how, in this mortal
state, I can remain happy and yet be <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>I should like to know what you consider them to be. Do you hold
introspection as one of them?</p>

<p>I certainly do. The analysis of one's own feelings, and the sense
of watching the fluctuating symptoms of one's individuality, form
one of the principal consolations of our mortal state.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>I think I should give it another name.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hermes</span> [<i>who has come up behind them, and bending forward has

<p>My name for it would be the indulgence of personal vanity.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> [<i>speaks louder, while the conversation becomes general,
except that</i> <span class="smcap">Zeus</span> <i>takes no part in it</i>].</p>

<p>You may call it so, if you please, but it is a source of genuine
pleasure to us.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus.</span></p>

<p>Ignorance is doubtless another of these consolations&mdash;ignorance
chemically modified by a few drops of the desire for knowledge....
[<i>Enthusiastically.</i>] And all the chastened forms of recollection,
how delightful they are, and how they add to our satisfaction here!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Nike.</span></p>

<p>It would be interesting to me to understand what you mean by
chastened forms of recollection. I don't think that is my
experience.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pallas.</span></p>

<p>I conceive memory as a pure, unbiased emotion, an image of past
life cast upon an unflawed mirror. Why do you say "chastened"?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;bus.</span></p>

<p>That memory which is nothing but a plain

<!-- Page 210 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
reproduction on the mirror
of the mind is a tame concern, Pallas. It transfers, without
modification, all that is dull, and squalid, and unessential. The
only memory which is worthy of those who have tasted immortality is
that which has in some degree been fortified. To recollect with
enjoyment is to select certain salient facts from an experience and
to be oblivious of the rest; or else it is to heighten the exciting
elements of an event out of all proportion with historic fact; or
it even is to place what should be in the seat of what precisely
was.... But this must be done firmly, logically, with no timidity
in reminiscence, so that the mind shall rest in a perfectly
artistic conviction that what it recollects is all the truth and
nothing but the truth. This is chastened, or, if you prefer it,
civilised memory. But Zeus is about to speak.</p>

blood of the barbarians. We cannot resist, we can but submit and
withdraw.... The ships fleet closer. They are like monstrous fishes
of living silver. I confess this is not what I anticipated. This is
not what my faint dream seemed to indicate. What inspires the
implacable destroyer to pursue us, and with this imposing and
miraculous navy, to the shore of that harmless exile in which we
were endeavouring to forget his existence, I know not. But let us
at least preserve that dignity which

not needful for you, Zeus, to punish or to be clement. Under the
inevitable rebound of his impious frenzy, himself has sealed his
doom for ever and ever. It is now for the Father of Heaven, and
these his children, to resume their immortality and to regain their
incomparable abodes. Be it my reward for the joyous labour of
